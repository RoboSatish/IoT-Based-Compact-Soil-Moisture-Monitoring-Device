# IoT-Based-Compact-Soil-Moisture-Monitoring-Device

There are several soil monitor sensors available that can be easily interfaced with the Arduino or other Embedded modules and can be programmed for different types of projects such as Smart Agriculture Monitoring System. The problem is not having a combined, retrofit module that can easily be used in different projects or applications as needed. In this project, we will build a low-cost connected solution with a pre-designed Soil monitor using different components.
